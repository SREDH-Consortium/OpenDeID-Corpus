## About HSA Biobank 

The HSA biobank is a collaborative initiative based at the Lowy Cancer Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. It aims at supporting researchers and clinicians for the advancement in the field of translational cancer research across Australia and internationally. The HSA Biobank houses all types of tumour tissues obtained from patients who have undergone surgery at one of the HSA hospitals and have provided their consent to the HSA biobank. Please refer to for more information.

## About OpenDeID Corpus

The OpenDeID  corpus is the first Australian based gold-standard corpus for patient de-identification. This corpus can used for development of automated patient de-identification systems using rule based or machine learning approaches. The corpus comprises of 2,100 pathology reports consisting of approximately 717 tokens per report from 1,833 cancer patients with 38,414 PHI entities annotated. The overall inter-annotator agreement and deviation scores for all three settings were 0.9464 and 0.9503 respectively. The corpus is manually annotated with surrogate information and measures have been taken to make sure there is no indetifiable informaiton.

## FAQs

1.  Will the corpus be made accessible with real identifiers in it ? if it will include identifiers, is this what the consent covered? 

We have generated surrogates using the approach described in [1]. No identifiable information will be made available under any circumstances. The corpus will be made accessible with surrogate identifiers only. 

2.   Does the original patient consent cover to share data available for research ?

HSA biobank is an institutional biobank with consent from patients to link and share information for future research. Please refer to [1-2] for patient consent forms and consenting process. Researchers need to provide a scientific research protocol with their request. Researchers need to be approved by data access committee to use the corpus and are not allowed to distribute the corpus.

3.   Can we re-distribute the corpus to our collaborators ? 

No, the corpus is only available for use to those approved by the data access committeee.
